ott.184.t:0 "The Sadrazam Is Dead!"
ott.184.d:0 "After 16 years of being in office to both Sultan Mehmed VI and Sultan Abdulmecid II, Ahmet Tevfik Paşa has died. At the age of 91 he was still able to restore order to an empire on the brink of collapse. Inviting exiled politicians and working with the Germans he reforged the Committee of Union and Progress. After restoring order he tried with all his might to keep status quo, even if it meant not reforming the nation. But now with his death the CUP is on edge. While the Sadrazam was in power many ideologies were held in place inside the Empire, but now with his death these ideologies can leak into the mainstream, destroying the status quo. As well as this, the ideologies provide one thing the Empire is in much need of; reforms."
ott.184.a:0 "He Will be missed."

ott.185.t:0 "Who will replace the Sadrazam?"
ott.185.d:0 "Unlike most cases, there is no clear successor to the old sadrazam, however three options have manifested themselves with strong positions of power to replace the Sadrazam. First is Mustafa Kemal, hero of Gallipoli and an excellent general. He has recently gained much support from the military and the liberal aspects of the empire. He advocates for liberal reforms that would turn the empire into a constitutional monarchy, with the sultan simply being a figurehead, and the real power being vested into the Ottoman parliament and the Vizier. Many conservatives question his proposed reforms, citing the fact that the Sultan has and should remain the undisputed head of state. Secondly is Sultanzade Sabahaddin. Once an exiled family member of house Osman, he came back to the empire to help continue and stabilize Tevfik's status quo. He promises gigantic reforms and a new model of mass decentralization, with power almost entirely held within the Vilayet. Supporters of the monarchy in the empire are doubtful, and believe that he may attempt to transform the empire into a western-style constitutional monarchy. However, with such bold reforms, nostalgia for the old could cause instability. Lastly is Kazim Karabekir. Following in the steps of Ahmet Tevfik, he also promises status quo for the nation as well as minor reforms in making the gigantic bureaucracy smaller and allowing minorities more autonomy in the Empire. Backed by the many ethnic groups like the Syrians and Kurdish people, he is a strong candidate wanting to hold the peace in the fragile bubble that is the Empire. Soon, the nation will decide who shall take the great reins of the Empire."
ott.185.a:0 "The Cabinet declares Mustafa Kemal Sadrazam!"
ott.185.b:0 "The Cabinet chooses Kazim Karabekir to be Sadrazam!"

ott.1.t:0 "The Sublime State"
ott.1.d:0 "Once the greatest empire in existence, spanning three continents and ruling over millions of people the Ottoman Empire had declined by the late 19th century, to the point of being known as the 'sick man of Europe'. An inability to industrialise, the nonexistence of an educated middle-class, and a chronic lack of funds meant that the Ottoman State had dropped back well behind the European powers by 1876, when Abdülhamid II took the throne. At the time, the Ottoman army was still reeling from the shock of the Russo-Turkish war of 1877, the Ottoman treasury had just declared bankruptcy and several interest groups were scheming to obtain political control of the Empire. These weaknesses led the Empire to seek closer cooperation with European powers. Prussian military successes against France led the Empire to form military and economic ties with the Germans, culminating in the construction of the Berlin-Baghdad railway in 1888. During his reign Abdülhamid II launched massive education programs and made desperate diplomatic manoeuvres to keep his Empire intact; while at the same time he engaged in systematic repression of opposition groups in an effort to maintain his absolute rule. Despite these efforts, a revolt of the 'Young Turks' in 1908, the subsequent dethronement of Abdülhamid II in 1909, and a bloody coup in 1913 meant that in the days leading up to the Weltkrieg, the Ottoman Empire was ruled by a triumvirate of 'Three Pashas'; Enver Pasha, Talaat Pasha and Djemal Pasha. In 1914, as the Weltkrieg began in Europe, the Young Turk government signed a secret treaty with the Germans and soon after joined the war against the Entente powers..."
ott.1.a:0 "God save the Empire..."

ott.2.t:0 "Black Monday hits Ottoman Empire!"
ott.2.d:0 "Almost a month ago, the Berlin Stock Exchange plunged into bottomless depths, throwing the economy of the German Empire into an unprecedented crisis. Now the shock waves of the crash have reached the Ottoman Empire. German and Austrian-owned companies have closed down or laid-off their workers, the Ottoman lira is losing it's already-low value, and resource exports are shrinking. Our unstable economy is on the verge of collapse..."
ott.2.a:0 "Great Allah protect us!"

ott.3.t:0 "Initial Stabilisation"
ott.3.d:0 "With the first wave of the crisis slowly passing by, some less affected branches of the economy have bounced back from the bottom. Still, the overall state of our economy does not look optimistic..."
ott.3.a:0 "Let's hope stabilisation will come soon..."

ott.4.t:0 "Government Intervention"
ott.4.d:0 "With at least partial political stabilisation finally in place, we are prepared to enact a series of intensive reforms, aimed at restoring pre-crisis industrial power."
ott.4.a:0 "Excellent!"

ott.5.t:0 "Further Stabilisation"
ott.5.d:0 "Thanks to renewed interest of foreign companies, our economy continues to regain pre-crisis efficiency."
ott.5.a:0 "Keep it up!"

ott.6.t:0 "Request of the International Jewish Lobby"
ott.6.d:0 "The Ottoman authorities have always welcomed the Jews. Since the reign of Sultan Bayezid II, who allowed the settlement of the Iberian Jews in his lands after their expulsion from Spain, they have been an integral part of the empire. However, since the rise of Zionism, laws have been passed to prevent the mass-settlement of foreign Jews in Palestine, while avoiding restriction on their pilgrimages. Recently we have been approached by members of the international Jewish lobby, asking for less constricting laws."
ott.6.a:0 "Very well, allow limited settlement of foreign Jews in Palestine."
ott.6.b:0 "Grant complete freedom of settlement to all non-Ottoman Jews."
ott.6.c:0 "We will not jeopardise the stability of Palestine!"

ott.7.t:0 "Settlers in Palestine"
ott.7.d:0 "The incredible number of Jews who flocked towards Palestine after the passage of new Settlement Laws caused a drastic demographic change in the region. Since their settlement in Jerusalem and the environs, it has become clear that Hebrew is rapidly becoming the second, and some might even argue first language of Palestine. The ideals of Zionism have also entered our lands, and several Judaic factions have already requested increasing amounts of autonomy, even verging on demands for independence."
ott.7.a:0 "Our greatness came from centralised government, we are not giving away power!"
ott.7.b:0 "Grant them local autonomy."

ott.8.t:0 "The Great Arab Revolt!"
ott.8.d:0 "In the middle of 1944, faced with mounting oppression from their Turkish masters, several Arab cities erupted in open revolt. Mobs began burning down Ottoman institutions and raided police and military bases. From Baghdad to Jerusalem, Arabs have risen up against the Ottoman Empire."
ott.8.a:0 "We will crush them!"

ott.9.t:0 "Second Arab Revolt!"
ott.9.d:0 "In the middle of 1946 several Arab tribes united their efforts to destabilise the Ottoman Empire again. Will it succeed this time?"

ott.10.t:0 "Arab Revolt Crushed"

ott.12.a:0 "Oh shid you caught me :DDDD"

ott.13.t:0 "Status Quo Antebellum"
ott.13.d:0 "After narrowly escaping defeat and destruction in the Weltkrieg, the Ottomans found that they had lost much for little gain. Suffering through 12 years of war, disease and poverty, the Ottoman Empire had gained nothing to show for it. Following the gloomy conclusion of the disastrous war, Enver, Talat and Cemal Pashas attempted to reinforce their authority, but the Committee of Union and Progress government had lost all credibility by then. Added to this was the immense pressure from various groups to prosecute the Young Turks responsible for dragging the Empire into war. This quickly led to the downfall of the triumvirate, who escaped abroad. With German support the Ottoman Sultan had regained a semblance of authority, albeit weak. Unfortunately the Germans had an interest in maintaining the status quo and so consistently backed the monarchy in any clashes with opposition groups, while at the same time letting Sultan Mehmed VI know that non-compliance on his part would lead to a withdrawal of their support. In 1936 then the Empire is staggering and slipping. More and more groups demanding reforms are appearing, to be joined by various nationalist groups intent on achieving independence. Economically too it is reliant on German support, especially the oil trade from the Middle East. In other words the Ottoman Empire is now regarded as the 'terminally ill man of Europe'."
ott.13.a:0 "Calm before the storm..."

ott.14.t:0 "Our Lands Expand"
ott.14.d:0 "Following years of contention involving domestic Arab nationalists, the Ottoman Empire has released several of its provinces to our control."
ott.14.a:0 "Good for them!"

ott.15.t:0 "Nawruz Day Riots"
ott.15.d:0 "Dissatisfaction in the Kurdish parts of our empire has reached a boiling point, with many demanding greater autonomy and some going as far as to demand outright independence. March 21st is an important date for these separatists, as it marks the day of traditional spring festivities and the Persian New Year. During this year's Nawruz celebrations, a seemingly small incident in Diyarbakır quickly got out of hand and turned into large-scale revolt. Protests and riots are erupting across our Kurdish provinces, and while we have reason to suspect the Syndicalists are behind it all, many Kurdish landowners and tribes have declared their support for the movement as well."
ott.15.a:0 "This does not look good..."

ott.16.t:0 "Kurdish Uprising"
ott.16.d:0 "As the Ottoman Gendarmerie failed to defuse the situation, Kurdish riots grew day by day. The rebellious Kurdish subjects of the Sultan had grown tired of the repression and lack of autonomy. Open uprisings were reported in all Kurdish majority areas of the Empire. Could this be the final blow to Sick Man of Europe?"
ott.16.a:0 "We'll see..."

ott.17.t:0 "Report from the East"
ott.17.d:0 "With regions inhabited by Kurds in open rebellion, the stability of the Ottoman Empire is on the verge of collapse since one successful uprising can cause a Domino effect in our Arab provinces and subject states. We must crush this uprising quickly."
ott.17.a:0 "Crush the enemies of the Devlet-i Aliye!"
ott.17.b:0 "Perhaps they deserve independence..."

ott.18.t:0 "Kurdish Uprising Crushed!"
ott.18.d:0 "Our military has successfully taken control of all Kurdish national territory. Once again their uprising was futile."

ott.19.t:0 "Kurdistan Remains Defiant!"
ott.19.d:0 "Even the concentration of our elite armed forces has been unsuccessful in breaking apart the rebellious state of Kurdistan. Some members of the general staff suggest that continuing with this fruitless effort greatly weakens our forces facing the hostile Arab states of the peninsula as well as Egypt. Perhaps we should recognise the independence of Kurdistan?"

ott.20.t:0 "Kurds Join The Uprising"
ott.20.d:0 "The eruption of the Kurdish uprising in the Ottoman Empire convinced part of our Kurdish population to leave the country to join the fighting. Shall we allow them to leave our country to join the uprising?"

ott.22.t:0 "The Future of Kurdistan"
ott.22.d:0 "After the bloody liberation war against the Ottomans it is now time to decide the fate of Kurdistan. Shall we introduce democracy based on the people's will to Kurdistan, or do we need the stability offered by a monarch to lead us to prosperity?"
ott.22.a:0 "Introduce democracy to Kurdistan!"
ott.22.b:0 "A Kurdish King shall bring stability!"

ott.23.t:0 "General Elections in Kurdistan!"
ott.23.d:0 "Since the beginning of the struggle for freedom many different parties have claimed that they are the one true ruler of Kurdistan. Four big parties have a chance of winning, Partiya Sosyalisti, a radical socialistic party. The second party is the Partiya Demokrate Kurdistan, a social conservative party. The third option is the Partiya Azadi, a social democratic party! The last choice is the radical Partiya Serbokho, a nationalist party."

ott.24.t:0 "Foreign Affairs"
ott.24.d:0 "During the election Partiya Sosyalisti said that if they would win they would seek protection and cooperation from the Internationale, now it is time to decide if we should do so or remain in isolation."
ott.24.a:0 "Try to join the Internationale."
ott.24.b:0 "Isolationism will protect Kurdistan."

ott.25.t:0 "Kurdistan In The Internationale?"
ott.25.d:0 "Our Socialist friends in Kurdistan want to join the Internationale, hoping that membership in our alliance will protect the independence of their newborn state. Although some eager officers are arguing for the immediate acceptance of Kurdistan into the Internationale, most of them are against such a drastic move, and opt for a simple guarantee of their independence."
ott.25.a:0 "Invite Kurdistan into the Internationale!"

ott.28.a:0 "Fransa bize bohmir"

ott.29.t:0 "The Ottoman Public Debt Administration"
ott.29.d:0 "Founded in 1881 the Ottoman Public Debt Administration (OPDA) was an European-controlled organisation that monitored and collected debt owed by the Ottoman State to European creditors in the private and public sectors. Most of the debt had been owed to French and British government as well as private institutions and had, as a consequence, been unilaterally defaulted by the Ottoman government when revolution swept away the regimes in London and Paris. However, the OPDA is still in existence and is now fully controlled by German and Austrian administrators, mainly concerned with regaining the capital loaned to Kostantiniyye during the Weltkrieg."

Another 'İrâde-i Seniyye' that went into effect an hour later effectively suspended the constitution and enforced a media blackout that aimed to suppress all information about the dissolution of the Ottoman Chamber of Deputies. Nevertheless, the news quickly spread throughout the capital and the rest of the empire.

It forms an indivisible whole, from which no portion can be detached under any pretext whatever.\nArticle 2. Kostantiniyye is the capital of the Ottoman Empire.\nArticle 3.

ott.106.d:0 "Our chief legal experts argue that in the decision-making process, judges should have freedom to decide cases impartially, in accordance with their interpretation of the law and the facts; that they should be able to act without any restriction or improper influence. They claim that one of the most important standards underpinning the autonomy of the judiciary is immovability, that is, for ordinary judges to be appointed permanently until retirement. Shall we give such guarantees of independence to our judges?"

ott.107.d:0 "While the Article 108 of the Ottoman Constitution declares that the vilayets shall be governed by the principle of 'decentralisation', this de jure principle has never transformed into action. Now that our sweeping administrative reforms are underway, the proponents of the doctrine of 'Adem-i Merkeziyet' are again asserting that subordinating local decision-making to the central bureaucracy results in tremendous inefficiency and pointless delays. With our distant subjects chafing under the direct rule of Kostantiniyye, it would be wise to give more power to local governments over our centrally-appointed governors. Shall we grant greater powers and freedoms to the administrative councils of our Vilayets?"

ott.108.a:0 "What is this insolence?!"

ott.109.t:0 "Interference in Courts!"
ott.109.d:0 "In former days, local administrators and military governors could freely interfere with legal proceedings, and sometimes even upturn court decisions. Such interference, coupled with corruption, quickly gave rise to injustice and public discontent. And although with our judicial reforms we aimed to prevent any such events from occurring again in the future, we are still receiving petitions from aggrieved peasants detailing high-level interference in courts of law."
ott.109.a:0 "Who dares interrupt justice?"

ott.110.t:0 "Ineffective Administration"
ott.110.d:0 "It has been several months since we formally adopted the metric system and the Standard Ottoman script, but we are still receiving troubling reports of incompetent bureaucrats being completely unable to use the new standards of measurement, while dozens of nearly-illiterate government officials have been discovered after they have proved incapable of deciphering the new form of official writing. It appears that the full implementation of these reforms will take more time than anticipated."
ott.110.a:0 "Who hired all these useless officials?!"

ott.111.t:0 "Corrupt Bureaucracy"
ott.111.d:0 "The notoriously widespread corruption in the Ottoman bureaucracy is a long-established phenomenon. Over the centuries, low wages and even lower moral standards of Ottoman government officials resulted in the gradual acceptance and normalisation of bribery as a means of income. Legitimised under terms such as 'hediye' and 'caize', corruption became so commonplace that several Ottoman sultans were recorded to have accepted bribes. Many efforts to curtail corruption were made over the centuries, none of them successful. Unfortunately, it seems that our coordinated efforts to end bribery are about to meet the same fate. The reforms we instituted, which include new laws and severe penalties, are being casually disregarded by the old-headed bureaucrats, almost all of whom are feeling quite secure in their entrenched positions in the government. Several reports we have received indicate that any action taken against these corrupt officials are quickly covered-up by complicit superiors and high officials. It appears that eliminating corruption will not be an easy task."
ott.111.a:0 "Reinstitute the anti-bribery oath!"

ott.112.t:0 "Report on Corruption"
ott.112.d:0 "Today we received a very troubling report concerning the unlawful use of crown lands in Yalova. According to this report, several bureaucrats from the Treasury are colluding with local administrators in Yalova in order to embezzle from Mukataa farmland revenues. Yet another group in the same region is illegally renting out Royal Property belonging to the nieces of the Sultan. The report further claims that both groups are being protected through shady bookkeeping in the Ministry of Interior. According to our royal accountants, this shameless act of robbery is costing us up to millions of Reichsmarks every year! Should we investigate these claims?"
ott.112.a:0 "I want action on this!"

On Sultan's orders, Muharrem Arif Paşa was leading the 'Royal Investigation into Corruption' concerning the embezzlement of Yalova crown land revenues. Several witnesses reported seeing two assassins firing at Muharrem Paşa from an unmarked white car before driving away. There is no doubt that the assassination is linked to the Yalova case, and the search for the white car is already underway."

ott.115.t:0 "Evidence Points To Teceddüt"
ott.115.d:0 "The Yalova arrests attracted great attention, and were protested by several prominent politicians, Mehmed Cavid Bey of Teceddüt Party foremost among them. From the preliminary reports, it appears that many of the corrupt officials had connections to the Teceddüt and Selamet-i Osmaniye Parties, and the Undersecretary of the Interior currently under arrest was a close relative of Mehmed Cavid Bey, who nominated him for the position in 1917 during his time as Minister of Finance. And even though the money trail does not reach Mehmed Cavid Bey, evidence conclusively shows that he worked to cover-up the scandal and protect the corrupt officials through his political connections.
